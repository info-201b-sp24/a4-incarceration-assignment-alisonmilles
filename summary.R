# As mentioned in the introduction, I wanted to focus on the difference between white and black prison rates specifically. 
# This is because I feel there is the biggest disparity between the two, and it shows the racial disparities and how broken our system is.
# Using DPLYR, the first value I found is the highest rate of black prisoners in a county. 
#This value turned out to be Mitchell County in Georgia. 
# The second value I calculated was the county in which the lowest black prison rate is located. 
# The answer I got for this was Winston County, in Alabama. I did these values to see if there was a regional difference in the incarceration rate of black individuals, but I did not find anything of weight.
# Moving on, for the third value I calculated the King County, Washington black prison rate in the most recent year of the data (2018).
# This was calculated to be 1190.4. My fourth value was a comparison of that, with being the white prison rate in King County in the most recent year (2018). 
# This was calculated to be 156.32. Even in 2018, not that long ago, there is still that much of a disparity. 
# King County should be noted as having far more white people than black people as well. 
# My next two values are also comparisons of each other. The first one is the urban county that has the highest black prison rate, which is Arlington County, in Virginia. 
# The second value, was the highest rate of white incarceration in an urban county, which was Oklahoma County, Oklahoma. 
# These were compared to see the difference of a white incarceration rate versus a black incarceration rate even in highly populated areas.
